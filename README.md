# Rubiks Cube Solver
Rubik's Cube solver is a python/ kivy based android application that uses opencv's template recognition to get the current state of a 3x3 Rubik's cube. After getting the current state of the cube, the application then proceeds to apply kociemba's algorithm to figure out a near-optimal solution for the cube. Additionally, the app provides a timer that provides scramble and standard speedcubing basic statistic to keep track of the user's times and solving speed. Currently the application is in development, but it will soon be released to Google Play.
